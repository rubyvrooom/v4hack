Following boards are in front of you:<BR>
MSP430F5529 - Main LaunchPad board<BR>
CC3100 - WiFi plug-on board<BR><BR>

It's enough to put power cable only into the MSP430F5229 board. The wifi will be powered from it<BR>

## Energia IDE
http://energia.nu/<BR>
Energia is an open-source electronics prototyping platform â€¦. with the goal to bring the Wiring and Arduino framework to the Texas Instruments MSP430 based LaunchPad. <BR>
The Energia IDE is cross platform and supported on Mac OS, Windows, and Linux. <BR<BR>

## Setup guide for the MSP430F5529
http://energia.nu/pin-maps/guide_msp430f5529launchpad/<BR><BR>


When you connect the board to your computer it's should create 2 COM ports.<BR>
One is marked as MSP Application and the other as MSP Debug.<Br>
The Debug is used to upload your code to the LaunchPad board. Serial monitor works on the Application port.<BR>

## WiFi API reference
http://energia.nu/reference/wifi/<BR>

To test out the wifi connection select "GetMacAddress" sample in the Energia IDE:<BR>
https://github.com/energia/Energia/blob/master/hardware/cc3200/libraries/WiFi/examples/GetMacAddress/GetMacAddress.ino<BR>
You'll have to manually specify the SSID and password, ie:
` WiFi.begin("HackathonV4", "hackhack");`<BR>
Once compiled and loaded into the LaunchPad over the MSP Debug COM port, start a Serial Monitor on debug interface and reset the board. ( Location of the reset button: http://www.mouser.com/images/microsites/TI_MSP-430F5529LP_overview.jpg )<BR>
Serial interface should display the connection progress, obtained IP address and MAC address of the board.
